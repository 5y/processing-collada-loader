This project is based on the work of Markus Zimmermann:
http://wiki.enterpriselab.ch/el/projects:colladaloader:colladaloader

I made some improvements so that also files from current Google Sketchup may be loaded.

Maybe this library works also with COLLADA files from other authoring tools. But bear in mind that this loader doesn't yet implements the whole COLLADA Specification.

Feel free to contribute to this project!
